		"10 Things I Hate About You" Comfort In A film
	</h1>
	
	<p> "10 Things I Hate About You is a film directed by Gil Junger that follows the genres of <strong>Romace and Comedy</strong> or more popularly called <em>"Romcom"</em>. This movie surrounds Kat Stratford and Patrick Verona. This movie became a famous name throught multiple housholds, and it has made its way in mine as well. This is considered my favorite movie because of the likeable characters and comedic pairings. This opened my eyes to the beauty of "Romcom" movies and sparked my interest in the world of film.</p>
